# EF (EdgeFuck)
Ever wanted to **fully remove Microsoft Edge**, but every so-called "solution"
leaves you frustrated?
- It **still takes up storage.**
- It **still shows up in the App List.**
- It **still runs in the background.**
- And no matter what you try, you **just can't get rid of it.**

Yeah, *EdgeFuck* is the perfect tool for you. It does all of that, when you run it,
and when you let it run as a background service, so that it keeps an eye out for
any incoming updates that Microsoft might try to bring the browser back from the
dead. Compiling already existing YouTube videos into one, this project will be a
big one, considering that Microsoft Edge isn't liked by certain users.

Microsoft, if you are reading this, ***I dare you*** to flag this as a **malicious**
software, like you did with other projects that allow the customization capabilities.
One example is that [winutil](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil) by Chris
Titus Tech, which got flagged by you guys. Evidence? [This

## Questions 
### Why name it like that?
That's one of your probable questions, why did I name this project as "EdgeFuck" in
the first place? Well, certain people don't like the fact that Microsoft's modern
web browser is forced upon them, and since certain people want this garbage out of
the system, even though it's not entirely garbage, I decided to make things easier
for people that want to take control of their system, allowing users to make the
browser truly "fuck off". Another point is an already established tool called
[RegFuck](https://github.com/UnforeseenOcean/REGFuck), which instead of Registry
Fuckery, it would rather be "MS Edge Browser Fuckery", hence the name, "EdgeFuck".
Third point, Microsoft is known for their Spyware tactics, and therefore, it would
be understandable, if people want Microsoft to stop with this tactic entirely, even
though it might not even be successful in the next 5–10 years. So, for this third
point, forcefully remove this browser to eliminate one of the Spying tactics.

*TL;DR (too long; didn't read)*:
- Microsoft Edge is forced on every Windows installation
- People dislike the browser, and Microsoft wants you to use theirs instead
- Project is designed to remove Edge easier
- Name inspired by RegFuck, making it into EdgeFuck
- Browser's removal is the force and spying tactics, making the removal another
  point

### Alternatives without completely breaking stability
Now, the best alternative to Windows and the browser itself is Linux, therefore this
tool would completely render useless because it's designed for Windows. Now, of
course, Linux isn't perfect, neither is macOS and Windows. Sure, it still doesn't
support all the devices, drivers (or as we call them, kernel modules) and games,
it became stable over the years. I would recommend testing Linux in a VM first,
before fully adjusting to the OS first. Also, Linux is not an OS, it's a Kernel.
Linux distributions are operating systems, such as Ubuntu, Zorin OS, Linux Mint,
Arch Linux and much, much more. What your first distro is, this depends on your
choosing and findings, what fits you well. I'm not the one to talk about your first
distro, since I'm an Arch Linux user, and no, I am not suggesting Arch to new users.

In case you don't want to waste time on learning Linux, another alternative is macOS.
Now, sure, they might force Safari, but what do I know? I don't even own a MacBook,
so I can't prove that.

*TL;DR (too long; didn't read)*:
- Linux is the best alternative
- Certain devices, drivers and games aren't fully supported (looking at Kernel-level
  Anti-Cheats)
- Recommendation to test Linux in a VM first
- Beginner-friendly distros are Ubuntu, Zorin OS and Linux Mint
- Different alternative is macOS, with the potential force of Safari's web browser

## What’s Coming
A full description of EF features is coming soon. But know this:

EdgeFuck doesn't just uninstall Microsoft Edge. It makes sure that it never sees the
light of day ever again on your setup. It helps your system to be customizable and
to get in control of what you do.

## Planned features
Here would be a list of the planned features for this project:

- **Edge Removal**: Obviously, the whole purpose is to remove the browser
- **Browser Detection & Installation**: In case Edge is your only browser installed,
  EF will give you a list of popular browsers for installation.
- **EF Background Service** (Optional, Recommended): Monitors your system to look out
  for any unwanted updates (e.g. updates bringing Edge back)
- **Configuration Customizability**: Modify the project with the use of a
  configuration file
